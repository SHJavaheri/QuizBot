## NOTE
This is not an official discord bot, just something I created to help out with school. However, if you are interested in this bot and believe it may help you in your group Discord studies, feel free to use it! Just know, you you won't be able to install this bot like any other 'official' bot on the market. You need to clone the github onto your own IDE (Ex. Pycharm) and simply run it locally!
